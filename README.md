# Junior Technical Interview Workshop

Glad to see you here, we hope you will enjoy these challenges. If you complete a step, please notify the mentor.

## 1) Register to Github

## 2) CSS assignment
 - Open the following CodePen link: [http://codepen.io/EggDice/pen/GpKJMZ](http://codepen.io/EggDice/pen/GpKJMZ). It will contain an HTML example, that shows four yellow boxes on the bottom. 
 - Please fork the project (don't sign up for CodePen).
 - Your task is to modify the code of your forked project
 - Make the 3rd box's border blue and its background purple
 - Create a fifth box with green background and blue border

## 3) Algorithm assignment
 - Roll with k4!
    - 1 -> Bubble sort
    - 2 -> Insertion sort
    - 3 -> Selection sort
    - 4 -> Shake sort
 - There are four lists of numbers: (Roll with k4 again!)
    - 1 -> [8,2,1,3,7,6,9]
    - 2 -> [5,1,2,9,7,3,8]
    - 3 -> [1,7,3,6,8,2,9]
    - 4 -> [9,3,5,8,1,7,2]
 - We sort the picked list with the selected algorithm, to order the numbers. For example: [8,2,1,3,7,6,9] -> [1,2,3,6,7,8,9]
 - Please describe the state of the list in the first eight steps(swap or not) only.
